MAIN PROJECT

Cryptocurrency markets have witnessed unprecedented growth and volatility in recent years, making them an attractive area for research and investment. Predicting cryptocurrency prices accurately remains a challenging task due to their complex nature and susceptibility to various external factors. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of machine learning-based approaches for cryptocurrency price prediction. We systematically analyze the existing literature, focusing on the methodologies, features, datasets, evaluation metrics, and challenges encountered in predicting cryptocurrency prices.

SCOPE:
The scope of this study encompasses the following aspects of cryptocurrency price prediction Data Collection and Preprocessing Gathering relevant data sources, including historical price data, trading volumes, social media sentiment, and macroeconomic indicators. Preprocessing data to ensure quality, consistency, and suitability for analysis. Feature Engineering and Selection: Identifying and engineering features that capture meaningful information for predicting cryptocurrency prices. Exploring techniques for feature selection to enhance model performance and efficiency.
